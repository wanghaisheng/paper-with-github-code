## abstracts:
Although using third-party libraries has become prevalent in contemporary software development, developers often struggle to update their dependencies. Prior works acknowledge that due to the migration effort, priority and other issues cause lags in the migration process. The common assumption is that developers should drop all other activities and prioritize fixing the vulnerability. Our objective is to understand developer behavior when facing high-risk vulnerabilities in their code. We explore the prolific, and possibly one of the cases of the Log4JShell, a vulnerability that has the highest severity rating ever, which received widespread media attention. Using a mixed-method approach, we analyze 219 GitHub Pull Requests (PR) and 354 issues belonging to 53 Maven projects affected by the Log4JShell vulnerability. Our study confirms that developers show a quick response taking from 5 to 6 days. However, instead of dropping everything, surprisingly developer activities tend to increase for all pending issues and PRs. Developer discussions involved either giving information (29.3\%) and seeking information (20.6\%), which is missing in existing support tools. Leveraging this possibly-one of a kind event, insights opens up a new line of research, causing us to rethink best practices and what developers need in order to efficiently fix vulnerabilities.
