## abstracts:
We investigate the model completeness of a mixed characteristic henselian valued field with finite ramification relative to the residue field and value group. We address the case in which the valued field has a value group with finite spines, and the case in which the value group is elementarily equivalent to the infinite lexicographic sum of $\mathbb{Z}$ with a minimal positive element. In both cases, we find a one-sorted language in which the theory of the valued field is model complete, if the theory of the residue field is model complete in the language of rings.
