## abstracts:
In the ever-growing Internet of Things (IoT) landscape, smart power management algorithms combined with energy harvesting solutions are crucial to obtain self-sustainability. This paper presents an energy-aware adaptive sampling rate algorithm designed for embedded deployment in resource-constrained, battery-powered IoT devices. The algorithm, based on a finite state machine (FSM) and inspired by Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Reno's additive increase and multiplicative decrease, maximizes sensor sampling rates, ensuring power self-sustainability without risking battery depletion. Moreover, we characterized our solar cell with data acquired over 48 days and used the model created to obtain energy data from an open-source world-wide dataset. To validate our approach, we introduce the EcoTrack device, a versatile device with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) capabilities and Long-Term Evolution Machine Type Communication (LTE-M) connectivity, supporting MQTT protocol for cloud data relay. This multi-purpose device can be used, for instance, as a health and safety wearable, remote hazard monitoring system, or as a global asset tracker. The results, validated on data from three different European cities, show that the proposed algorithm enables self-sustainability while maximizing sampled locations per day. In experiments conducted with a 3000 mAh battery capacity, the algorithm consistently maintained a minimum of 24 localizations per day and achieved peaks of up to 3000.
