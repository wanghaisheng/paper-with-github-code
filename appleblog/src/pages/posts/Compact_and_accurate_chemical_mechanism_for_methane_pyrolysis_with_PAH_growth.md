## abstracts:
A reliable and compact chemical mechanism of gas-phase methane pyrolysis leading to formation of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules has been developed. This model is designed for studies of carbon nanostructure synthesis such as carbon black and graphene flakes, including soot growth kinetics. Methane pyrolysis with carbon nanostructure synthesis is a two-stage process where conversion of CH4 to C2H2 precedes the growth of PAH molecules from acetylene. We present a single chemical mechanism that accurately describes both stages. We have constructed a compact and accurate chemical mechanism capable of modeling both stages of methane pyrolysis based on the ABF mechanism which was expanded with most prominent reaction pathways from the mechanism by Tao for small PAH molecules and HACA pathways for larger PAH molecules, up to 37 aromatic rings. The resulting mechanism was validated through comparison to multiple available sets of experimental data. Good agreement with the experimental data for both processes was obtained. Performance of the mechanism was tested for pyrolysis of methane-rich mixtures under long residence times leading to abundant formation of PAH molecules. It is shown that the inclusion of larger PAH species (up to A37) in the chemical mechanism is important for accurate prediction of the fraction of carbon converted to PAH molecules and, correspondingly, residual fraction of acetylene in the mixture.
