## abstracts:
Magnetic fields regulate black hole (BH) accretion, governing both the inflow and outflow dynamics. When a BH becomes saturated with large-scale vertical magnetic flux, it enters a magnetically-arrested disk (MAD) state. The dynamically-important BH magnetic flux powers highly efficient relativistic outflows (or jets) and sporadically erupts from the BH into the disk midplane. Here we explore the evolution of MADs when the BH and gas angular momentum are misaligned, which is expected to be more common. Using numerical simulations, we find that jets from rapidly spinning, prograde BHs force the inner accretion flow into alignment with the BH spin via the magneto-spin alignment mechanism for disks initially misaligned at $\mathcal{T}\lesssim 60^{\circ}$. Extremely misaligned MAD disks, on the other hand, exhibit intermittent jets that blow out parts of the disk to $\approx 100$ gravitational radii before collapsing, leaving behind hot cavities and magnetized filaments. These intermittent jet mechanism forms a mini-feedback cycle and could explain some cases of X-ray and radio quasi-periodic eruptions observed in dim AGN. Further, we find that (i) for BHs with low power jets, the BH spin and initial disk tilt angle changes the amount of horizon magnetic flux, and (ii) geometrically-thick, misaligned accretion flows do not undergo sustained Lense-Thirring (LT) precession. Thereby, we suggest that low-luminosity accreting BHs ($\dot{M}\ll 10^{-3} \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$) are not likely to exhibit quasi-periodic oscillations in lightcurves due to LT precession, in agreement with observations of BH X-ray binaries and AGN in the low-hard/quiescent state. Instead, we suggest that magnetic flux eruptions can mimic precession-like motion, such as observed in the M87 jet, by driving large-scale surface waves in the jets.
