## abstracts:
A growing planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk induces three-dimensional gas flow, which exhibits a midplane outflow that can suppress dust accretion onto the planet and form global dust substructures (rings and gaps). Because analytic formulae for the planet-induced outflow are useful for modeling its influences on local and global dust surface densities and planet accretion, we derive the analytic formulae that describe the morphology and velocity of the planet-induced outflow. We first perform three-dimensional, nonisothermal hydrodynamical simulations of the gas flow past a planet, which enables us to introduce a fitting formula describing the morphology of the outflow. We then derive an analytic formula for the outflow speed using Bernoulli's theorem. We successfully derived a fitting formula for the midplane outflow morphology (the shape of the streamline), which is valid when the dimensionless thermal mass falls below $m\lesssim0.6$. The obtained analytic formulae for the outflow, such as the maximum outflow speed and the velocity distributions of the outflow in the radial and vertical directions to the disk, show good agreement with the numerical results. We find the following trends: (1) the maximum outflow speed increases with the planetary mass and has a peak of $\sim$30--40$\%$ of the sound speed when the dimensionless thermal mass is $m\sim0.3$, corresponding to a super-Earth mass planet at 1 au for the typical steady accretion disk model, and (2) the presence of the headwind (namely, the global pressure force acting in the positive radial direction of the disk) enhances (reduces) the outflow toward the outside (inside) of the planetary orbit. The planet-induced outflow of the gas affects the dust motion when the dimensionless stopping time of dust falls below ${\rm St}\lesssim\min(10m^2,0.1)$.
