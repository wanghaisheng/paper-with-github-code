## abstracts:
Internet of Things applications have gained widespread recognition for their efficacy in typical scenarios, such as smart cities and smart healthcare. Nonetheless, there exist numerous unconventional situations where IoT technologies have not yet been massively applied, though they can be extremely useful. One of such domains is the underground mining sector, where enhancing automation monitoring through wireless communications is of essential significance. In this paper, we focus on the development, implementation, and evaluation of a LoRa-based multi-hop network tailored specifically for monitoring underground mining environments, where data traffic is sporadic, but energy efficiency is of paramount importance. We hence define a synchronization framework that makes it possible for the nodes to sleep for most of the time, waking up only when they need to exchange traffic. Notably, our network achieves a sub 40us proven synchronization accuracy between parent-child pairs with minimum overhead for diverse topologies, rendering it highly viable for subterranean operations. Furthermore, for proper network dimensioning, we model the interplay between network's throughput, frame size, and sampling periods of potential applications. Moreover, we propose a model to estimate devices' duty cycle based on their position within the multi-hop network, along with empirical observations for its validation. The proposed models make it possible to optimize the network's performance to meet the specific demands that can arise from the different subterranean use cases, in which robustness, low power operation, and compliance with radio-frequency regulations are key requirements that must be met.
