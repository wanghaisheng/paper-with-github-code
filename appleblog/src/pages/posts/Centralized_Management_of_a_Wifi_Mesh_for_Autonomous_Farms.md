## abstracts:
Emerging autonomous farming techniques rely on smart devices such as multi-spectral cameras, collecting fine-grained data, and robots performing tasks such as de-weeding, berry-picking, etc. These techniques require a high throughput network, supporting 10s of Mbps per device at the scale of tens to hundreds of devices in a large farm. We conduct a survey across 12 agronomists to understand these networking requirements of farm workloads and perform extensive measurements of WiFi 6 performance in a farm to identify the challenges in meeting them. Our measurements reveal how network capacity is fundamentally limited in such a setting, with severe degradation in network performance due to crop canopy, and spotlight farm networks as an emerging new problem domain that can benefit from smarter network resource management decisions. To that end, we design Cornet, a network for supporting on-farm applications that comprises: (i) a multi-hop mesh of WiFi routers that uses a strategic combination of 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands as informed by our measurements, and (ii) a centralized traffic engineering (TE) system that uses a novel abstraction of resource units to reason about wireless network capacity and make TE decisions (schedule flows, assign flow rates, and select routes and channels). Our evaluation, using testbeds in a farm and trace-driven simulations, shows how Cornet achieves 1.4 $\times$ higher network utilization and better meets application demands, compared to standard wireless mesh strategies.
