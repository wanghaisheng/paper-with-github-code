## abstracts:
Millimeter-wave superconducting resonators are a useful tool for studying quantum device coherence in a new frequency domain. However, improving resonators is difficult without a robust and reliable method for coupling millimeter-wave signals to 2D structures. We develop and characterize a tapered transition structure coupling a rectangular waveguide to a planar slotline waveguide with better than 0.5 dB efficiency over 14 GHz, and use it to measure ground-shielded resonators in the W band (75-110 GHz). Having decoupled the resonators from radiative losses, we consistently achieve single-photon quality factors above $10^5$, with a two-level-system loss limit above $10^6$, and verify the effectiveness of oxide removal treatments to reduce loss. These values are 4-5 times higher than those previously reported in the W band, and much closer to typical planar microwave devices, demonstrating the potential for low-loss on-chip millimeter wave quantum technology.
