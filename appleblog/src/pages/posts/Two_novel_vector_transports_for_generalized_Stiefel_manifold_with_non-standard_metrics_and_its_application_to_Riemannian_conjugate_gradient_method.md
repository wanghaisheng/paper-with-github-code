## abstracts:
This paper proposes two innovative vector transport operators, leveraging the Cayley transform, for the generalized Stiefel manifold embedded with a non-standard inner product. Specifically, it introduces the differentiated retraction and an approximation of the Cayley transform to the differentiated matrix exponential. These vector transports are demonstrated to satisfy the Ring-Wirth non-expansive condition under non-standard metrics while preserving isometry. Building upon the novel vector transport operators, we extend the modified Polak-Ribi$\acute{e}$re-Polyak (PRP) conjugate gradient method to the generalized Stiefel manifold. Under a non-monotone line search condition, we prove our algorithm globally converges to a stationary point. The efficiency of the proposed vector transport operators is empirically validated through numerical experiments involving generalized eigenvalue problems and canonical correlation analysis.
