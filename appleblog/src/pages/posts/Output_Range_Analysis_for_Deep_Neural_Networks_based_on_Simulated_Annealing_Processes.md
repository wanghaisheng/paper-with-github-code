## abstracts:
This paper tackles the challenging problem of output range estimation for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), introducing a novel algorithm based on Simulated Annealing (SA). Our approach addresses the lack of local geometric information and high non-linearity in DNNs, making it versatile across various architectures, especially Residual Neural Networks (ResNets). We present a straightforward, implementation-friendly algorithm that avoids restrictive assumptions about network architecture. Through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations, including tests on the Ackley function, we demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in navigating complex, non-convex surfaces and accurately estimating DNN output ranges. Futhermore, the Python codes of this experimental evaluation that support our results are available in our GitHub repository (https://github.com/Nicerova7/output-range-analysis-for-deep-neural-networks-with-simulated-annealing).
