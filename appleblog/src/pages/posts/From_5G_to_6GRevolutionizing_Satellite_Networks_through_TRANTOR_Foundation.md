## abstracts:
5G technology will drastically change the way satellite internet providers deliver services by offering higher data speeds, massive network capacity, reduced latency, improved reliability and increased availability. A standardised 5G ecosystem will enable adapting 5G to satellite needs. The EU-funded TRANTOR project will seek to develop novel and secure satellite network management solutions that allow scaling up heterogeneous satellite traffic demands and capacities in a cost-effective and highly dynamic way. Researchers also target the development of flexible 6G non-terrestrial access architectures. The focus will be on the design of a multi-orbit and multi-band antenna for satellite user equipment (UE), as well as the development of gNodeB (gNB) and UE 5G non-terrestrial network equipment to support multi-connectivity.
