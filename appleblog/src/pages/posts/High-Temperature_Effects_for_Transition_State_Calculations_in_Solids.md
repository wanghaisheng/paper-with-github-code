## abstracts:
Transition state calculation is a critical technique to understand and predict versatile dynamical phenomena in solids. However, the transition state results obtained at zero Kelvin are often utilized for prediction or interpretation of dynamical processes at high temperatures, and the error bars of such approximation are largely unknown. In this benchmark study, all the major temperature effects including lattice expansion, lattice vibration, electron excitation, and band-edge shift are evaluated with first-principles calculations for defects diffusion in solids. With inclusion of these temperature effects, the notable discrepancies between theoretical predictions at zero Kelvin and the experimental diffusivities at high temperatures are dramatically reduced. Particularly, we find that the lattice expansion and lattice vibration are dominant factors lowering the defect formation energies and hopping barriers at high temperatures, but the electron excitation exhibits minor effects. In sharp contrast to typical assumption, the attempt frequency with lattice expansion and vibration varies significantly with materials: several THz for aluminum bulk but surprisingly over 500 THz for 4H-SiC. For defects in semiconductors, the band-edge shift is also significant at high temperatures and plays a vital role in the defect diffusion. We expect this study would help accurately predict the dynamical processes at high temperatures.
