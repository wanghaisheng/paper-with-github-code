## abstracts:
In this article, we provide criteria for the Cohen-Macaulayness of the associated graded ring of a Gorenstein noncomplete intersection monomial curve $C$ in the 4-dimensional affine space. We also give an explicit formula for the minimal number of generators of the defining ideal of the tangent cone of $C$ at $0$.
## QA:
None
