## abstracts:
We propose polarization of scattered optical light from intermediate Galactic latitude infrared cirrus as a new diagnostic to constrain models of interstellar dust and the anisotropic interstellar radiation field (aISRF). For single scattering by a sphere, with Mie scattering phase functions for intensity and polarized intensity for a dust model at a given wavelength (Sloan $r$ and $g$ bands), and with models of anisotropic illumination from the entire sky (represented in HEALPix), we develop the formalism for calculating useful summary parameters for an integrated flux nebula (IFN): average of the phase function weighted by the illumination, polarization angle ($\psi$), and polarization fraction ($p$). To demonstrate the diagnostic discrimination of polarization from scattered light, we report on the effects of different anisotropic illumination models and different dust models on the summary parameters for the Spider IFN. The summary parameters are also sensitive to the IFN location, as we illustrate using FRaNKIE illumination models. For assessing the viability of dust and aISRF models, we find that observations of $\psi$ and $p$ of scattered light are indeed powerful new diagnostics to complement joint modeling of the intensity of scattered light (related to the average phase function) and the intensity of thermal dust emission. However, optically thin IFNs that can be modelled using single scattering are faint and $p$ is not large, as it could be with Rayleigh scattering, and so these observations need to be carried out with care and precision. Results for the Draco nebula compared to the Spider illustrate the challenge.
