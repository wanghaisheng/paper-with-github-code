## abstracts:
The openness and influence of video-sharing platforms (VSPs) such as YouTube and TikTok attracted creators to share videos on various social issues. Although social issue videos (SIVs) affect public opinions and breed misinformation, how VSP users obtain information and interact with SIVs is under-explored. This work surveyed 659 YouTube and 127 TikTok users to understand the motives for consuming SIVs on VSPs. We found that VSP users are primarily motivated by the information and entertainment gratifications to use the platform. VSP users use SIVs for information-seeking purposes and find YouTube and TikTok convenient to interact with SIVs. VSP users moderately watch SIVs for entertainment and inactively engage in social interactions. SIV consumption is associated with information and socialization gratifications of the platform. VSP users appreciate the diversity of information and opinions but would also do their own research and are concerned about the misinformation and echo chamber problems.
