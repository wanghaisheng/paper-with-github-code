## abstracts:
Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian local ring and $M$ a finitely generated $R$-module. We introduce a general form of the classically studied trace map that unifies several notions from the literature. We develop a theory around these objects and use it to provide a broad extension of a result of Lindo calculating the center of $\operatorname{End}_R(M)$. As a consequence, we show under mild hypotheses that in dimension $1$, the canonical module of $Z(\operatorname{End}_R(M))$ may be calculated as the trace submodule of $M$ with respect to the canonical module of $R$.
