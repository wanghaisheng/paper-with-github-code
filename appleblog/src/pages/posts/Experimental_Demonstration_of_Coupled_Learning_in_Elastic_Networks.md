## abstracts:
Coupled learning is a contrastive scheme for tuning the properties of individual elements within a network in order to achieve desired functionality of the system. It takes advantage of physics both to learn using local rules and to "compute" the output response to input data, thus enabling the system to perform decentralized computation without the need for a processor or external memory. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept mechanical network that can learn simple tasks such as self-symmetrizing via iterative tuning of individual spring rest lengths. These mechanical networks could feasibly be scaled and automated to solve increasingly complex tasks, hinting at a new class of "smart" metamaterials.
## QA:
None
