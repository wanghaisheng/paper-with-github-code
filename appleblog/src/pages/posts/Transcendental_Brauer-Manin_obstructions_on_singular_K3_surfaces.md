## abstracts:
Let E and E' be elliptic curves over Q with complex multiplication by the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic field K and let Y=Kum(ExE') be the minimal desingularisation of the quotient of ExE' by the action of -1. We study the Brauer groups of such surfaces Y and use them to furnish new examples of transcendental Brauer-Manin obstructions to weak approximation.
