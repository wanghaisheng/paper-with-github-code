## abstracts:
Linear complementary dual (LCD) codes and linear complementary pairs (LCP) of codes have been proposed for new applications as countermeasures against side-channel attacks (SCA) and fault injection attacks (FIA) in the context of direct sum masking (DSM). The countermeasure against FIA may lead to a vulnerability for SCA when the whole algorithm needs to be masked (in environments like smart cards). This led to a variant of the LCD and LCP problems, where several results have been obtained intensively for LCD codes, but only partial results have been derived for LCP codes. Given the gap between the thin results and their particular importance, this paper aims to reduce this by further studying the LCP of codes in special code families and, precisely, the characterisation and construction mechanism of LCP codes of algebraic geometry codes over finite fields. Notably, we propose constructing explicit LCP of codes from elliptic curves. Besides, we also study the security parameters of the derived LCP of codes $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D})$ (notably for cyclic codes), which are given by the minimum distances $d(\mathcal{C})$ and $d(\mathcal{D}^\perp)$. Further, we show that for LCP algebraic geometry codes $(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})$, the dual code $\mathcal{C}^\perp$ is equivalent to $\mathcal{D}$ under some specific conditions we exhibit. Finally, we investigate whether MDS LCP of algebraic geometry codes exist (MDS codes are among the most important in coding theory due to their theoretical significance and practical interests). Construction schemes for obtaining LCD codes from any algebraic curve were given in 2018 by Mesnager, Tang and Qi in [``Complementary dual algebraic geometry codes", IEEE Trans. Inform Theory, vol. 64(4), 2390--3297, 2018]. To our knowledge, it is the first time LCP of algebraic geometry codes has been studied.
