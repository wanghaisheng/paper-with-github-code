## abstracts:
In our first paper, we looked at $2$-generated primitive axial algebras of Monster type with skew axet $X'(1+2)$. We continue our work by focusing on larger skew axets and classifying all such algebras with skew axets. This brings us one step closer to a complete classification of all $2$-generated primitive axial algebras of Monster type.
