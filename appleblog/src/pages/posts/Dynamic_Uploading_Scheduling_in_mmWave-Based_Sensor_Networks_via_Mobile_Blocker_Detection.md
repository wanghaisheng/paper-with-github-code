## abstracts:
The freshness of information, measured as Age of Information (AoI), is critical for many applications in next-generation wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Due to its high bandwidth, millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is seen to be frequently exploited in WSNs to facilitate the deployment of bandwidth-demanding applications. However, the vulnerability of mmWave to user mobility typically results in link blockage and thus postponed real-time communications. In this paper, joint sampling and uploading scheduling in an AoI-oriented WSN working in mmWave band is considered, where a single human blocker is moving randomly and signal propagation paths may be blocked. The locations of signal reflectors and the real-time position of the blocker can be detected via wireless sensing technologies. With the knowledge of blocker motion pattern, the statistics of future wireless channels can be predicted. As a result, the AoI degradation arising from link blockage can be forecast and mitigated. Specifically, we formulate the long-term sampling, uplink transmission time and power allocation as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) with discounted cost. Due to the curse of dimensionality, the optimal solution is infeasible. A novel low-complexity solution framework with guaranteed performance in the worst case is proposed where the forecast of link blockage is exploited in a value function approximation. Simulations show that compared with several heuristic benchmarks, our proposed policy, benefiting from the awareness of link blockage, can reduce average cost up to 49.6%.
